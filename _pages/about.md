Hello.
I am currently a second-year graduate student at the College of Optical Science and Engineering, Zhejiang University. My research focuses on aberration correction and adaptive optics to enhance the performance of optical microscopy. By leveraging super-resolution techniques, adaptive optics, and computational modeling, I aim to image cellular structures in complex, dynamic biological environments. My goal is to explore the secrets and behavior of live-cells by correcting aberrations to achieve deeper, wider, and higher spatial-temporal resolution 3D imaging. My research interest includes computational imaging, adaptive optics, super-resolution microscopy.
