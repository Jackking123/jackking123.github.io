**Hello!**
**I am currently a second-year master student from [College of Optical Science and Engineering](http://opt.zju.edu.cn/), [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/), China.**

**My research focuses on aberration correction and computational adaptive optics to enhance the performance of optical microscopy. By leveraging super-resolution techniques, adaptive optics, and computational modeling, my goal is to explore the secrets and behavior of live-cells by correcting aberrations to achieve deeper, wider, and higher spatial-temporal resolution 3D imaging. My research interest includes computational imaging, adaptive optics, super-resolution microscopy.**

**During my master’s program, I have been working in [Prof. Cuifang Kuang’s Lab](https://person.zju.edu.cn/cfkuang#926116), actively engaging myself in a number of projects related to adaptive optics in wide-field super-resolution microscopy such as Single Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) and Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM).**
