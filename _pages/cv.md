Work experience
======
* **Feb 2024 – Present: Computational Adaptive Optics based on Neural Wavefront Representation**
  * Introduced neural computational AO, which is a method that integrates maximum   likelihood estimation, measurement modulation, and neural signal representation; using deep learning techniques, it can fit both system and sample-induced aberrations under wide-field microscopy for live cell imaging
  * Implemented the computational AO algorithm using PyTorch, designed the network structure, generated simulation data, and established the training workflow
  * Tested the algorithm with simulated data, with currently biological testing still ongoing to make adjustments and ensure its reliability and accuracy
    
  * Supervised by Prof. Cuifang Kuang and collaborated with Assoc. Prof. Hongfei Zhu at The Chinese University of Hong Kong

* **Jun 2023 – Jan 2024: Accurate 3D SMLM localization via Vectorial In-situ PSF Retrieval and Aberration Assessment**
  * Introduced VISPR (Vectorial in-situ PSF retrieval) method to consider both system- and sample-induced aberrations in single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) for precise 3D super-resolution reconstruction in deep tissues
  * Developed and implemented an algorithm based on the vectorial PSF model and maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) phase retrieval to accurately localize single molecules in complex imaging conditions
  * Validated the VISPR method using simulation datasets and experimental studies, confirming its superior fitting ability with fluorescent bead samples and single-molecule images of Nup98-AF647 on the nuclear envelope in U-2 OS cells
    
  * Supervised by Prof. Cuifang Kuang

* **Jan 2023 – May 2023: Image Quality Metrics-based Adaptive Optics for Aberration Correction in Super-Resolution Microscopy**
  * Calibrated deformable mirrors (DM) by building interferometer system to achieve accurate modulation
  * Designed an automatic aberration correction program based on metric-based AO; implemented in LabView to iteratively analyze and optimize the system’s optical performance by correcting system-induced aberration
    
  * Supervised by Prof. Cuifang Kuang

* **Sept 2022 – Present: Control Software Development for 4Pi Modulated Illumination Super-Resolution Microscopy System**
  * Designed a multimodal control system using LabVIEW, integrating multiple imaging modes: 2D Structured Illumination Microscopy (SIM), 3D SIM and 4Pi interference-based Single-Molecule Localization Microscopy (SMLM) 
  * Responsibilities included interface design, synchronization, and communication between different hardware components (e.g., laser, linear translation stage, sCMOS camera, Acousto-optic Tunable Filter (AOTF), and galvo scanning system), image signal acquisition, and multimodal function switching
  
  * Supervised by Prof. Cuifang Kuang
